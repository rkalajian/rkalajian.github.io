Every new site needs a "Hello World" post, don't they? Well, this one does, especially since I came from a tech background before I started freelance writing.

I'm Rob, and I go by the handle Devar-TTY. For the longest time I was a Web Developer and System Administrator, while also operating [A Pawn's Perspective](https://pawnsperspective.com), a tabletop gaming site.

I'm a huge nerd, and grew up in an just as video games were becoming huge, knowing the luxury of tabletop gaming and RPGs as well as those of the Atari, NES, Master System, and every console since then. Yes, I'm old. My first PC was a Tandy 1000 from Radio Shack.

Now I stream weekdays on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/devartty), and write for [Gfinity Esports](https://www.gfinityesports.com/author/rob-kalajian) and one of their children sites, [RealSport 101](https://realsport101.com/author/rob-kalajian/) where I write about Fortnite, Apex, Legends, Genshin Impact, and more. I also raise money for charity through [Extra Life](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.participant&participantID=453427), and by selling [inclusivity-based gaming merch through Threadless](https://yawamt.threadless.com/).

I'll be using this space to post some written reviews, articles, thoughts, and future fundraising efforts.

Thanks so much for joining me on this wild ride.
