# Team Expiration

Just because we expire a lot in online games doesn't mean we have an expiration date.

Team Expiration is a group of "older" gamers looking to play their favorite online games in a friendly environment even though their skills may have gotten a bit rusty over the years.

We also fundraise for Extra Life, so checkout our [team page](https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&teamID=56801) and make a donation to help some kiddos.
